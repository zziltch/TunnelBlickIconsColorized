# Colorized TunnelBlick Icons

Colorized versions of the TunnelBlick menu icons from the official Tunnelblick source code repository at [https://github.com/Tunnelblick/Tunnelblick](https://github.com/Tunnelblick/Tunnelblick)

Works best with dark mode.

GIMP template files have been included so other colors can be generated. I may produce other color schemes in the future, and I welcome PRs.
